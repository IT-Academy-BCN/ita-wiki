# Technical Tests Guide for New Project Members

We offer the possibility to do technical tests to assess your coding abilities but also to simulate the intensity and expectations of real-world technical interviews. This document outlines everything you need to know about accessing and completing these tests. The tests follow fixed criteria, but evolve in content and complexity to ensure they remain relevant and challenging.

### Eligibility Criteria

To ensure you're ready for the challenges these tests present, you must first:

1. **Complete 1 Month in the Project:** Spend at least 1 month (or 2 sprints) actively contributing to the project.
2. **Merge 4 Pull Requests:** Before accessing the first test, demonstrate your ability to contribute effectively by merging at least 4 pull requests.

### Initiating the Test Process

Upon meeting the eligibility requirements:

- **Contact Your Mentor on Discord:** Inform your mentor that you're ready to tackle the technical tests. Direct communication via Discord is preferred for prompt coordination.

### Test Structure and Submission

The technical test process is designed to challenge your coding skills and time management abilities under realistic conditions.

- **Test Reception:** Tests are distributed at 9 AM. You will receive your test directly from your mentor.
- **Time Limit:** You have 4 hours to complete and submit the test. Time management is crucial, as it mirrors the pressure of real-world scenarios and interviews.
- **Submission:** Your completed test should be submitted to a private repository. Remember to invite your mentor to this repository for them to review your work.
- **Review Call:** After submission, schedule a call with your mentor. This review session is not only to discuss your test submission but also to cover relevant theoretical concepts. It's a valuable opportunity for feedback and learning.

### Purpose of the Tests

- **Interview Practice:** These tests are specifically designed to prepare you for technical interviews, focusing on both practical coding tasks and theoretical knowledge.
- **Feedback and Growth:** Post-test discussions offer a chance to receive personalized feedback and deepen your understanding of key concepts.
